# DL_URLquery
This is an attempt to train a Deep Learning neural network to determine a "bad" query from a "good" one


To run:

python3 bad_or_good_url.py

It wil ask for a file with the hyperparams. Type in:
hyperparams.txt

Then add the URL you want to query.

It seems to be biased at labelling long URLS as bad and short ones as good so I am working on a better trainign set.
